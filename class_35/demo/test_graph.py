# Write tests to prove the following functionality:

# Node can be successfully added to the graph
# An edge can be successfully added to the graph
# A collection of all nodes can be properly retrieved from the graph
# All appropriate neighbors can be retrieved from the graph
# Neighbors are returned with the weight between nodes included
# The proper size is returned, representing the number of nodes in the graph
# A graph with only one node and edge can be properly returned
# An empty graph properly returns null
# Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
